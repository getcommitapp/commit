# The Commit protocol - RESTful API

## Section 1 - Overview

The Commit mobile app API allows clients (mobile apps) to manage accounts, goals, and groups. It is a RESTful API, where resources (users, goals, groups) are accessed via URLs, and actions are performed using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Clients must authenticate using a Bearer token (except `/signup`) for all requests. Responses are JSON-formatted, and standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure.

> [!NOTE]
> RESTful APIs are stateless: each request must include all authentication data.

## Section 2 - Transport Protocol

The API uses HTTPS as the transport protocol to ensure reliability and security. Requests and responses are JSON-formatted, UTF-8 encoded.

> [!NOTE]
> HTTPS is mandatory to protect sensitive information such as passwords and payment data.

> [!NOTE]
> All endpoints should respond with appropriate HTTP status codes:
>
> - `200 OK` - request succeeded
> - `201 Created` - resource created
> - `400 Bad Request` - invalid request
> - `401 Unauthorized` - authentication failed
> - `404 Not Found` - resource does not exist
> - `500 Internal Server Error` - server error
